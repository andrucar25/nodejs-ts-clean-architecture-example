# Node.js & TypeScript: Clean Architecture vs Traditional Approach

In this repository, you will find a simple project built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript** that connects to a database. Additionally, the same project has been refactored to follow the principles of **Clean Architecture** and leverage **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

The goal of this repository is to showcase the differences and highlight the importance of adopting **Clean Architecture** principles in software development.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Traditional Approach**
A basic implementation of a Node.js application with TypeScript that connects to a database. This approach focuses on a simple and straightforward design without additional architectural patterns.

### 2. **Clean Architecture Approach**
The same application has been refactored to follow **Clean Architecture**, implementing principles such as:
- Separation of concerns.
- Dependency inversion.
- Flexible and testable code.

This version utilizes **Object-Oriented Programming** to encapsulate logic and ensure maintainability.

## Why Clean Architecture?

Clean Architecture emphasizes:
- **Independence:** The business logic is decoupled from frameworks, UI, and database details.
- **Testability:** Core logic is easier to test in isolation.
- **Maintainability:** Code is structured for easier updates and scalability.
- **Reusability:** Clear boundaries allow for reusing core logic in different contexts.
